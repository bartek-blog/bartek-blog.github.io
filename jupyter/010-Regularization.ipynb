    "We are going to explain very important technique called regularization. We have already discuss that sometimes models overfit. If we observe that we could try to make model simpler. But it is not always possible and sometimes it is complicated to manually find out how to do this. So regularization is doing this for us in a sort of automated way. We will see how.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss here two very popular types of regularizations:\n",
    "* $l_2$ regularization\n",
    "* $l_1$ regularization.\n",
    "We will explain them using an example from <kaggle.com> the competition called __House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques__, see <https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques>. So please download `train.cvs` dataset from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "So are what $l_1$ and $l_2$ regularizations_ The name comes from the fact that those techniques try to reduce the variance of the predictions of the model. In simple words it means that they try to make predictions smoother. They do no change hyperparameters of the model, they change the function that is use to optimize parameters. Let's see.\n",
    "\n",
    "### l2 regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember what metric we have been using when we had evaluated regression model. We have been using MSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MSE(\\hat{Y}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i^N \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time this metric is used when we fit the training data to the model, that is when the train algorithm finds the best parameters. We have not been discussing how exactly it is done, but it is very important to understand that in the case of Linear regression this algorithm is trying to minimize the above function. In this context it is called __loss function__ or __objective function__. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be a bit confusing so let's repeat it and write it down. While we train the linear model\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = a_1x_1 + \\ldots + a_nx_n + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we call the method\n",
    "```\n",
    "reg.fit(X_train, y_train).\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then the algorithm behind the `fit` tries to find best parameters $a_1, \\ldots, a_n, b$ such the the __loss function__ given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(\\hat{Y}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i^N \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is as small as possible. In other words it is finding global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case __loss function__ and __evaluation metrics__ are the same. But it does not have to be that way. It is sometimes not possible to have them being equal, since optimization algorithms often require the loss function to be differentiable. But it also often beneficial to have them different. The first example is $l_1$ regularization. In this case __loss function__ is defined as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(\\hat{Y}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i^N \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2 + \\alpha \\sum(a_1^2 + \\ldots + a_n^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear model that use this loss function is also called __Ridge__ regression. Let's see how it works. In `sklearn` we have `Ridge` regression class. So what we will do is the following.\n",
    "1. We will prepare data by taking only numerical columns that do not have not defined values.\n",
    "2. We will do `train-dev-test` split.\n",
    "3. We will train standard linear model with it.\n",
    "4. We will train Ridge models using grid search to find the best alpha.\n",
    "5. We compare them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later we move to $l_1$ regularization."
