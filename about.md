Hi, 

I am Data Scientist and PhD in Dynamical System. I am passionate about Machine/Deep Learning. I
have experience in 
* processing natural languages, 
* building recommender systems, 
* forecasting sales,
* predicting user behavior,
* product development through experimentation,
* analysis of complex scenarios,
* defining KPIs,
* leading data team,
* mentoring and training in Data Science/Analysis

Moreover, I have many years of experience as an academic researcher and teacher. Now I collaborate
with Polytechnic University of Catalonia, University of Barcelona and Kschool with Machine Learning,
Deep Learning and Data Management courses. I am also coorganiser of Barcelona Data Science and
Machine Learning Meetup.

Here I have collected simple notes that I mostly use for educational proposes.
