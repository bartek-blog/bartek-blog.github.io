From hunspell's installation:

Dictionary files (*.aff and *.dic) should be placed in
~/Library/Spelling/ or /Library/Spelling/.  Homebrew itself
provides no dictionaries for Hunspell, but you can download
compatible dictionaries from other sources, such as
https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries .

Download dictionaries from http://wordlist.aspell.net/dicts/ and put them to /Library/Spelling/.
