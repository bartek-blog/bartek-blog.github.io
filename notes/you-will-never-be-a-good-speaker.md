## You will never be a good speaker

You will never be a good speaker, You will never be a good speaker: I have this internal voice that
is repeating it all the time. For years. It may be right. Why?
* First, I was always bad at languages. In school, I was slow with reading, (although I love it) I
  was never able to write a sentence without making mistakes. I was not able to learn any foreign
  language. I was only good at maths. Even that, once I solve all exercises on an exam but get the
  lowest mark since my professor refused to read my work, it was so badly written. 
* Second, (jitters) I panic when I have go out to public. I always finish with a stomach ache. This time
  probably as well.  
  
So I should rather do my work: mathematics, research, programming, enjoy my daily work, instead of
trying to be a good communicator. Right? But how often do you fell that, since you were not able to
transmit clearly your idea people are not following you? Or even some other idea was chosen and you
are suppose to follow it? And you are left with that feeling people do not give you a chance to at
least try it out. 

I had this felling few times in my live. How about you? Who has this felling because you were not
able to clearly explain your idea you, your organization, friends have lost an interesting
oportunity?

Now imagine that you were a great speaker, like Martin Luter King, and were able to so clearly
explain your dreams that everyone around you would fell that you are not talking about your idea,
but you are actually explain their greatest desire. 

I am not pretending that I could Martin Luter King, but I am left with no choice. 
We are left with no choice. There is no such a question like "can you, I, we  be a good speaker". 
The question is "How can you, I, we be a good speaker".

So one answer this kind of question? Google. There are many answers, but let me talk about 3 topics that I find particularly sound.

* Idea

You have to have one clear idea. Somthing that matter to your audience. Like: Everyone can be a good speaker. 

But in order to to cache attention you have state in an unsexpected way like: "you will never be a good speaker." 

And Do not go directly to the point. Make this idea personal. Tell soemthing personal, maybe a bit embarrassing. 

* Story


Stories are great, becouse thay have structure. A person lives normal live and is faced with
something that makes it difficult to continue her/his normal live. It can be a problem of a friend
that needs a help, or missing kid, or war or the end of the war.

How many times we tell collection of ideas without any order. We say this we say that. And we expect
other to follow, Imagine films done like that or books. Who would like to read them? Imagine that we
can give some atractive structure that would help our listner to follow. 

Nancy Duarte:  Many great talks seems to have a structure. 

They have this one idea that tey want to transmit. Thay describe not very attractive reality
contrast it with a imaginary world where this idea is applied. they go back and forth. Sad
reality-bright future that we all want.

We are these peple that are loosing oportunites in our lives becouse we are not able to clearly
comunite our ideas, But here, by being aware of the structure of great talks we would be able to
find others that share our ideas. And here in toastmaster club we have oportunity to pracice it and
then go out at change the world.

SO you see this the contrast I talk about

* The way we speak
