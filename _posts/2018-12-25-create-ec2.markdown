# EC2

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is Amazon service that allows rent virtual computers (see
<https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>). Here we explain how to launch EC2 instance with Ubuntu.

In order to create EC2 instance we need to configure the following
* Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
* Instance Type
* Security Groups
* Storage
* Key pairs

## Launch EC2

### Launch

Go to <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2> and choose `Launch Instance`.

### Key pair

#### Create key pair 

Create key pair, if you do not have one or want to use different.

After downloading move it to `.ssh`.
``` shell
mv bartek-aws.pem ~/.ssh
```

And set required permissions.
``` shell
cd ~/.ssh
chmod 400 bartek-aws.pem
```

#### Select key pair

Now you should be able to connect through `ssh`.
